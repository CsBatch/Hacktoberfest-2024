### Example

Sam's house is between s=7 and t=10. The apple tree is located at a=4 and the orange at b=12. There are m=3  apples and n=3 oranges. Apples are thrown apples=[2,3,-4] units distance from a, and oranges=[3,-2,-4] units distance. Adding each apple distance to the position of the tree, they land at [4+2,4+3,4+-4] . Oranges land at [12+3,12+-2,12+-4]. One apple and two oranges land in the inclusive range 7-10,
